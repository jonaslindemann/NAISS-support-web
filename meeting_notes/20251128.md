## Discussion 💬

* What do you think about the current implementation
  - The structure is good and relatively easy to use
  - Important to be open to changes
  - Issue: mkDocs is on the verge of being unsupported. Move to zensical? <https://zensical.org/>
* Should we write documentation for all NAISS systems, or just add links to current local implementations
  - Long running clusters is make sense, but clusters that are on the verge of being decommisioned then a link should suffice
* NAC information should be available within this infrastructure
* Could we use OpenProject for this endevour, or is it too small. No!
  - Wait for gitlab account as it has a kanban and wiki which could be used to manage the docs
* Software for trawling automatically what is available in the system and build YAML files accordingly 
* How to publish:
  - Everyone should be able to contribute
  - Document the procedure for publication.
  - A small team of staff should be responsible for publishing
* Important to write good documentation which is clear to users. A suggestion <https://diataxis.fr/>
