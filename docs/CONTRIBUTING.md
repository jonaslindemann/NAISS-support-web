is to document how to use our resources.
We welcome any contribution that helps us achieve this goal.

- follows all standards set by the continuous integration tools
  (e.g. use 4 spaces for indentation).

    - Modify the Markdown file

    - Click on the green 'Commit changes' button

## How long does it take until I see my changes on the website?

When your changes are committed to our main branch,
it takes several minutes until these are live.

One can see the process at
[the Actions page of this repository](https://github.com/menzzana/NAISS-support-web/actions).

## What if I make a mistake?

This repository has version control. Hence, if needed, we can undo any mistake.

It is more typical that mistakes are fixed.

TODO: add folder structure from meeting notes

## Which `git` branch should I use?

Submitting to the main branch is fine. Thanks!
