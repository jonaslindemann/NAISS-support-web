# NAISS user documentation

Welcome to the NAISS user documentation!

The goal of this page is to redirect you to where you want to go:

- [Getting access](#getting-access) (see below)
- [Documentation per HPC cluster](#naiss-documentation-per-hpc-cluster)
  (see below)
- [NAISS support](#naiss-support-availability) (see below)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md) for answers to your questions.
- [Our contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [Contact us](contact/contact_support.md).

## Getting access

<!--

RJCB: suggest to move this: this page is a redirect page.

I would enjoy this to be merge to 'Getting Access'

-->

To use a NAISS HPC cluster, one first needs:

- An account: see
  [how to apply for an account](getting_access/get_access.md#applying-for-an-account)
- An allocation: see
  [how to apply for an allocation](allocations/)


## NAISS documentation per HPC cluster

There are multiple HPC clusters maintained by NAISS.
For historical reasons, not all documentation is available on this website.
The table below brings you to the documentation of your favorite HPC cluster

## NAISS support availability

<!-- 
RJCB: suggest to move this: this page is a redirect page.

I would enjoy to see 'Support' as a heading, so that
a user can easily find it.

NAISS Support will have limited availability during
the summer and Christmas periods.
