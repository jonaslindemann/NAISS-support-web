# Allocations

## Getting compute time

Before running at NAISS, users must belong to at least one Time Allocation.

### Are you a researcher  PhD or higher  affiliated to swedish academia and requiring NAISS resources?

Research projects are handled through the [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) portal,
so applying/joining Time Allocation and applying for NAISS account must be done via [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se)

* If you want to start a new Time Allocation, see [Apply for a new Time Allocation via NAISS](#apply-for-a-new-time-allocation-via-naiss)
* If you are joining a research project that already has a Time Allocation at NAISS, see [Joining an existing Time Allocation](#joining-an-existing-time-allocation).

### Are you a student  Bachelor or Master level  requiring NAISS resources for your thesis?

We do not accept applications directly from students below PhD student level. However, your supervisor can apply on your behalf.

1. Ask your supervisor to [Apply for a new Time Allocation via NAISS](#apply-for-a-new-time-allocation-via-naiss).
1. You can then follow [Joining an existing Time Allocation](#joining-an-existing-time-allocation) as a project member.

## Apply for a new Time Allocation via NAISS

Most Swedish research projects are now handled at the national level in NAISS through [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se),
so managing Time Allocations, users membership
and applying for NAISS account should be done from your [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) page.

If you are applying for a new Time Allocation, you will automatically be designated as the Principal Investigator (PI).
As a PI, you should decide on the…

1. Compute-time per month for running jobs
1. Clusters intended for usage
1. Duration of the project.

Please keep in mind that the PI will apply for a Time Allocation to cover the needs of all the members in the research project.
The amount of resources for each type can be obtained in [https://SUPR.naiss.se/round/](https://supr.naiss.se/round/naiss/)
You can decide what allocation would suit the best for your project with the help of the table below:

| Description | Small allocation | Medium allocation | Large allocation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Applicant requirement | PhD student or higher | Senior scientist in Swedish academia | Senior scientist in Swedish academia |
| Proposal evaluation | Only technical evaluation | Only technical evaluation | Scientific and technical evaluation. Evidence of successful work on a medium allocation. |
| Time limit | Evaluated weekly | Evaluated monthly. Submission before the 15th every month | Evaluated by NAC twice a year |

Once you decide on the details of your Time Allocation, [Apply via a SUPR account](/getting_access/get_access/#apply-via-a-supr-account).
You can then login/signup on [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) and submit a proposal.
When you are a member of an active project, you may apply for a user account, in case you do not have it,
directly within [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se).
