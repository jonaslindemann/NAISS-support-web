# Getting Access

Information on how to be granted allocations can be read in [how to apply for an allocation](../allocations/index.md)

## Joining an existing Time Allocation

If you want to join an existing Time allocation, you have to login/signup to [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) and send an Project Membership Request using the [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) web interface.
You may then apply for a user account, if you do not have one, [Apply via a SUPR account](#apply-via-a-supr-account).

## Check your existing Time Allocation

You can see what Time Allocations you belong to in two ways:

1. If you have a [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) account, go to your [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) page and click on the Projects tab.
1. If you have a user account, you can login to any of our clusters and use the `projinfo` command.
   It will print the information of all the allocations you belong to and information on the recent usage of the allocation.

## Applying for an account

Once you know what allocation you will belong to, you are ready to apply for a user account.
You can apply for an account in one of following ways depending on the type of project.
