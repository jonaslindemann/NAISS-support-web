# Getting Access

## Getting compute time

Before running on PDC, users must belong to at least one Time Allocation.

### Are you a researcher  PhD or higher  affiliated to swedish academia and requiring PDC resources?

Research projects are handled through the [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) portal,
so applying/joining Time Allocation and applying for PDC account must be done via [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se)

* If you want to start a new Time Allocation, see [Apply for a new Time Allocation via NAISS](#apply-for-a-new-time-allocation-via-naiss)
* If you are joining a research project that already has a Time Allocation at PDC, see [Joining an existing Time Allocation](#joining-an-existing-time-allocation).

### Are you a student  Bachelor or Master level  requiring PDC resources for your thesis?

We do not accept applications directly from students below PhD student level. However, your supervisor can apply on your behalf.

1. Ask your supervisor to [Apply for a new Time Allocation via NAISS](#apply-for-a-new-time-allocation-via-naiss).
1. You can then follow [Joining an existing Time Allocation](#joining-an-existing-time-allocation) as a project member.

## Apply for a new Time Allocation via NAISS

Most Swedish research projects are now handled at the national level in NAISS through [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se),
so managing Time Allocations, users membership
and applying for PDC account should be done from your [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) page.

If you are applying for a new Time Allocation, you will automatically be designated as the Principal Investigator (PI).
As a PI, you should decide on the…

1. Compute-time per month for running jobs
1. Clusters intended for usage
1. Duration of the project.

Please keep in mind that the PI will apply for a Time Allocation to cover the needs of all the members in the research project.
You can decide what allocation would suit the best for your project with the help of the table below:

| Description            | Small allocation          | Medium allocation                                             | Large allocation                                                                                                                                              |

Once you decide on the details of your Time Allocation, [Apply via a SUPR account](#apply-via-a-supr-account).
You can then login/signup on [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) and submit a proposal.
When you are a member of an active project, you may apply for a PDC account, in case you do not have it,
directly within [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se).


## Joining an existing Time Allocation

If you want to join an existing Time allocation, you have to login/signup to [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) and send an Project Membership Request using the [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) web interface.
You may then apply for a PDC account, if you do not have a PDC account, [Apply via a SUPR account](#apply-via-a-supr-account).

## Check your existing Time Allocation

You can see what Time Allocations you belong to in two ways:

1. If you have a [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) account, go to your [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se) page and click on the Projects tab.
1. If you have a PDC account, you can login to any of our clusters and use the `projinfo` command.
   It will print the information of all the allocations you belong to and information on the recent usage of the allocation.

## Applying for an account

<!-- TODO: Apply for PDC account -->
