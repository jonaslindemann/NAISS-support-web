# Support tiers

Each software installation is categorized into one of three software support tiers, depending on the level of help we can provide for that particular software.

## Tier 1

A software gets placed into tier 1 if NAISS has an application expert on staff with deep knowledge about it, and we will try to help users with any problems. We have also done some internal tests to make sure that the software installation is working as intended with as good performance as possible. NAISS also commits to installing updates as they become available.

- Proactive software installations and updates
- Scientific domain knowledge
- Software specific knowledge
- Relatively few software titles

## Tier 2

The tier 2 is used when NAISS has staff with domain knowledge, but only limited experience with the specific software. For this category, we will try to help as much as possible. For example, if the software comes with a test suite, we will run it, and attempt to evaluate the results. We will try to install and test new versions, but mostly when this is requested by a user.

- Mostly reactive software installations and updates
- Some scientific domain knowledge
- Little or limited software specific knowledge
- More software titles

## Tier 3

Tier 3 is used for test installations or custom software we helped install by request of a user. In general, we will not be able to help much with such software titles. Note that these types of  installations can be completely untested, and will not be updated unless a user sends a request to NAISS support.

- Only reactive software installations and updates
- No scientific domain knowledge
- No software specific knowledge
- Many software titles
