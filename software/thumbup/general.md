Topology predictor of transmembrane helical proteins
using mean burial propensity.
Helices in membrane spanning regions are more tightly packed
than the helices in soluble proteins.
`THUMBUP` predicts transmembrane helical (TMH) segments and a
positive-inside rule to predict amino-terminal orientation.
